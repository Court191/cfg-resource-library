# Java

## What is Java?
---
Java is the most popular, widely used object-oriented programming language. It was originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystemsâ€™ Java platform. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 

When we compile a .java file, .class files (containing byte-code) with the same class names present in .java file are generated by the Java compiler. This .class file goes into various steps when we run it. These steps together describe the whole JVM. 

In comparison to other programming languages, Java stands alone for its security and functionality.

## What is Java used for?
---
Java provides a rich and wide range of API that helps programmers to develop applications. Using Java, we can develop different applications for different purposes. We can use Java technology to develop the following applications:

<li>Mobile App Development<li>
<li>Desktop GUI Applications<li>
<li>Web-based Applications<li>
<li>Gaming Applications<li>
<li>Big Data Technologies<li>
<li>Distributed Applications<li>
<li>Cloud-based Applications<li>
<li>IoT Applications<li>

## Examples to look at

### Pre-requisites

The CFG Introduction to Python Programming course would be a good starting point for the basics - control flow, data structures, functions - that will give the learner a first look at the programming concepts they will work with in Java.

Although being fluent in Javascritp is not a pre-requisite of learning Java, it will definitely make the learning process easier.
