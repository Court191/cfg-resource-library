***Recommendations to continue your learning***
For next steps I would reccomnd looking into:
<li>Java - Similar to C#</li>
<li>Python - A powerful Backend Language</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/didemertens/cfg-resource-library/blob/main/library/javascript-frameworks.md">JavaScript - Front End Development</a><li>

### Prerequisites
---
C# is a good place to begin for new starters. Would recommend compelting the Code First Girls Python Course but is not required. Any prior expereince in an Object Oriented Programming language, such as Java, would also help.
