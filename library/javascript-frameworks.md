# JavaScript Frameworks

## What are JavaScript frameworks?
---
JavaScript frameworks provide developers with ready to use code for common tasks, which makes building a JavaScript app a lot easier.

## What are JavaScript frameworks used for?
---
There are features almost all websites have, like linking up all your pages. You could code that from scratch, but it’s a lot easier to use a framework with pre-written and thoroughly tested(!) code. A lot of companies use a JavaScript framework, so many front-end (and full-stack) jobs require some framework experience.

## Examples to look at
---
React, Vue

When you are an aspiring developer, it can be really hard to choose a framework. There are so many and everyone has their own preference. Just remember that most frameworks work in a similar way. That means that it doesn’t matter if you see an interesting job but they work with a different framework. You can easily pick it up (and employers know that). So all you have to do is stick with one framework at first. Only when you’re very comfortable with it and have built a couple of projects, then you can look into other frameworks. 

At the moment, React is the most used JavaScript framework<sup>*</sup>, with Vue becoming more and more popular. Both frameworks are very beginner-friendly and fun to work with, so I suggest you look at the documentation and examples (and maybe jobs you find interesting) to decide which one you’ll focus on.

<sup>*</sup> React is technically a library, you can read more about that [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/is-react-a-library-or-a-framework/)

***Recommendations to continue your learning***

Look into server-side JavaScript, for example [Node with Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction) and then see if you can hook it up to React/Vue:

### Prerequisites
---
You should have intermediate level knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you haven’t already done so, complete the CFG web development course to get started. After that, focus on JavaScript by doing a couple more tutorials/courses before starting to learn a framework.
